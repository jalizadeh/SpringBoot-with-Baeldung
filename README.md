# Spring Boot with Baeldung
This repository contains the projects I create during learning Spring Boot from [baeldung.com](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot). I try to add something more to the project, as I wish or I learn during solving errors.

- [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) handles the front-end part, with a great integration with back-end. It provides some tags to show the data sent from back-end as objects. check [Introduction to Using Thymeleaf in Spring](https://www.baeldung.com/thymeleaf-in-spring-mvc) for more info.
