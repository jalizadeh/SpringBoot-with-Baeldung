# Spring Boot with Baeldung
This repository contains the projects I create during learning Spring Boot from [baeldung.com](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot). I try to add something more to the project, as I wish or I learn during solving errors.


## [1] [Bootstrap a Simple Application](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-start)
- [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) handles the front-end part, with a great integration with back-end. It provides some tags to show the data sent from back-end as objects. check [Introduction to Using Thymeleaf in Spring](https://www.baeldung.com/thymeleaf-in-spring-mvc) for more info.
	- [All the dialects](https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/standarddialect5minutes.html)

## [2] [Spring Boot Annotations](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-annotations)
- Annotations are to give special meanings to classes, methods & .... Annotations can make the app run in a desired way, by controlling the order, scope, value & many more options provided by Spring & Spring Boot.
